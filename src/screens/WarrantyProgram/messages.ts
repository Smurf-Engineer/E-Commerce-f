    <p><b>GARMENT CARE GUIDELINES:</b></p>
    <p>JAKROO Cycling, Nordic, Tri, and Running clothing is made to perform optimally for it’s intended use, not necessarily to last forever. </p>
    <p>Following these guidelines will help you get the longest functional use from your gear:</p>

    <p>2. Avoid chemicals, fabric softeners, and harsh soaps.</p>

    <p>4. Turn your gear inside out when washing, and don’t wash with zippers undone or with other items that could abrade your gear like Velcro.</p>
    <p>5. Get out there and enjoy your gear!</p>

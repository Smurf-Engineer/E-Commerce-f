We do, however, provide an optional Pro Review service at the time of order placement. For a small fee of $15.00, Jakroo’s Pro Designers will review each of the custom designs on your order and check for the following:</p><p><ul><li>Color consistency throughout design and ordered products</li><li>Center alignment and adjustment to graphics/text</li><li>Any other unforeseen issues</li></ul><p>We also provide free Pro Assist design support from within the Design Center that connects you directly with one of our professional designers. Look for the Pro Assist button at the top right of the Design Center. Our designers are there to answer any questions, review your design for accuracy and quality, or provide simple editing support. <br/> If there is any recommended work that would fall outside of the free design support, our designers will let you know in advance, to give you the option to move forward with the services.</p>`

      '<p>We need all logos and artwork to be Vector format. That way we can scale it, pull color from it and change it as needed for the design. The files are either eps or ai, created in Adobe Illustrator or similar vector program. If you cannot get Vector art, a high resolution Raster image may work for us, preferably a psd, tiff, or png file with transparent background. Please consult JAKROO to see if your artwork is usable. In most cases, we can convert logos into Vector format for an additional charge.

Additionally, the digital RGB representation of colors may vary from how those colors print on physical materials such as fabrics. Our creative team, however, has tried to calibrate the colors to be as close as possible to the actual print colors but a perfect match is impossible.</p><p>To address this challenge, a color printed fabric swatch guide of the Jakroo Color palette is available upon request. You can order your free fabric swatch in the Design Center or by contacting a member of our team by email or the online chat.</p>'

To solve this problem and ensure consistency of color, we typically use the Pantone Color system to reference colors. If you do not have access to a Pantone Color Book, we can send you our JAKROO Color Swatch. Conversely, you can send us a printed sample of the actual color you want and our Art Department will determine the equivalent Pantone or JAKROO color match.

      '<p>We need all logos and artwork to be Vector format. That way we can scale it, pull color from it and change it as needed for the design. The files are either eps or ai, created in Adobe Illustrator or similar vector program. If you cannot get Vector art, a high resolution Raster image may work for us, preferably a psd, tiff, or png file with transparent background. Please consult JAKROO to see if your artwork is usable. In most cases, we can convert logos into Vector format for an additional charge.

To solve this problem and ensure consistency of color, we typically use the Pantone Color system to reference colors. If you do not have access to a Pantone Color Book, we can send you our JAKROO Color Swatch. Conversely, you can send us a printed sample of the actual color you want and our Art Department will determine the equivalent Pantone or JAKROO color match. For more information on color, please <a href="mailto:customdesign@jakroousa.com">contact</a> our office.</p><br />'

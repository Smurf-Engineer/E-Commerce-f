    <p>The Company remains the exclusive owner of any such Design Element.</p>
    <p>Your use of Design Element is only permitted as a licensee for the specific and limited purpose of placing a Purchase Order of Products.</p>
    <p>The Company may revoke such license at any time in its own discretion. If the Company revokes such license and you have not breached or otherwise violated these Terms, the Company will refund your Purchase Order, and this will be your exclusive remedy. You may not resell, exploit, reproduce or otherwise use the Products commercially.</p><br />
    <p>The Company has the right, in its sole discretion, to reject any Purchase order or the use of any Customer IP on any Products that the Company considers in violation of these Terms or libelous, defamatory, obscene, profane (according to standards established by the FCC), portraying irresponsible use of alcohol or other substances, advocating persecution based on gender, age, race, disability or national origin, containing explicit sexual content or is otherwise inappropriate for production.</p><br />

    <p>Acceptance of Products and Product Return. Under no circumstances shall any Products be returned to Company nor orders canceled nor deliveries suspended by you without the Company’s prior written consent.

    <p><b>Indemnity.</b> You shall indemnify the Company and its officers, directors, agents, employees and consultants against all liability, loss, damage, costs and expenses whatsoever arising out of or relating to any breach by you of these Terms or from your negligence or intentional acts.</p><br />

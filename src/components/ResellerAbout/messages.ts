    <p>Members earn 10% on the fully priced sales from their own custom stores. Orders with a discount do not qualify 
    for the Reseller commissions. Commissions are based on the net sale amount less any applied shipping and 
    taxes and paid out to you in the currency based on your country of residence you designated during sign-up.</p>
    <p>At this time, only residents of the United States or Canada are eligible for the Reseller program. As such, 
    payouts are only denominated in USD or CAD respectively.</p>
    <p>You will receive commission payouts only on orders that have been fully shipped and paid the customer. If an 
    order has only been partially shipped or paid, you will not be paid until the order is shipped complete and paid in 
    full. In the event an order is returned or refunded to a customer for any reason after commissions have been paid 
    out, we reserve the right to deduct the paid commission amount from future earnings.</p>`

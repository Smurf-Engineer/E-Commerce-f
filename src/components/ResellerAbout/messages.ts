All retail collection items (non-customized) are returnable for a full refund or exchange, provided that the products are unworn and accompanied by the receipt. With our size exchange program, however, customers have the option of keeping their original item and ordering a different size at 50% of the original item price. Jakroo’s customer service team handles all customer facing warranty and exchange for orders through DirectShip stores.`
